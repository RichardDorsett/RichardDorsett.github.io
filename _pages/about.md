I am Professor of Economic Evaluation at the University of Westminster.  I conduct research into the labour market, in particular: employment, education, disadvantage and the policies/programmes that relate to these areas.  I specialise in empirical research and the application of econometric techniques to estimate causal impacts.  

From 2008 until 2016, I was Principal Research Fellow and Director of Policy Evaluation at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research. Before that, from 2000, I was Research Director at the Policy Studies Institute, also in London.  See [here](/assets/docs/CV.pdf) for a CV.
