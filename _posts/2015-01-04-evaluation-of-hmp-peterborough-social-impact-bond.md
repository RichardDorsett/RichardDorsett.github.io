The "One Service" at Peterborough Prison is a through-the-gate support programme intended to help offenders following their discharge.  It is also the first example in the world of an intervention financed as a Social Impact Bond (SIB).  This study involves estimating the impact of the One Service on re-offending.   This uses a propensity score matching approach, applied to administrative data on offenders.  The impact estimate is then used to determine payment to SIB investors.
