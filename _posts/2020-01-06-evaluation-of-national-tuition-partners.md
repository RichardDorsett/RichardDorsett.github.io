Tuition Partners is a national programme of subsidised tuition targeted at disadvantaged pupils needing catch-up support, to be delivered over the 2020/21 academic year.  It is part of the government's COVID catch-up plan to tackle the impact of school closures and lost teaching time in English schools.  This project estimates the impact of Tuition Partners on attainment.
