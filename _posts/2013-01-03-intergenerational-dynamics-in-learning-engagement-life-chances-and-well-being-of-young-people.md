This project forms part of the larger programme of research carried out by the LLAKES centre.  We examine two intergenerational processes.  The first concerns how parental education influences child education.  While others have explored this, our paper is the first to deal with the censored nature of child and parent education; such censoring being introduced by the existence of a minimum school-leaving age.  We show that failure to account for this can bias inference.  Our second paper examines ethnic variations in well-being and how this differs across recent migrants, longer-term first generation migrants, second generation migrants and "natives" (those born in the UK and with both parents also born in the UK).  We also explore characteristics and circumstances that appear correlated with well-being.
