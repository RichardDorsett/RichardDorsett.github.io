Rates of smoking and poverty are both high among lone parents.  Using longitudinal data, we explore the reasons behind this and, in particuar, the determinants of smoking among lone mothers over the period 1991-1996. Consideration is given to the initial conditions problem encountered when modelling dynamic panel probit models.
