Joint claims for Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA) was introduced on 19 March 2001.  From this date, unemployed couples without dependent children where one or both partners were over the age of 18, and at least one partner was born on or after 18 March 1976, were both required to make a joint claim. This involves both partners in meeting the labour market requirements of claiming JSA, including actively seeking work. Partners are exempt from these requirements where they are prevented from seeking work due, for example, to illness, disability or caring responsibilities. From 28 October 2002, the joint claims requirement was extended to couples where one or both partners were born after 28 October 1957. The evaluation of Joint Claims sought to assess its impact on movement away  from JSA and progress into work.
