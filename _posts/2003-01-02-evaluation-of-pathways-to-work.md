Pathways to Work ('Pathways') was introduced on a pilot basis following proposals in the 2002 DWP Green Paper 'Pathways to Work: helping people into employment'.  Since then, it has been rolled out in stages, achieving nationwide coverage in April 2008.  Pathways is aimed at improving opportunities among people claiming incapacity benefits. To this end, it introduced a number of innovations for those beginning an incapacity benefits claim, including:  a faster Personal Capability Assessment; a series of Work Focused Interviews (WFIs), mandatory for most customers, carried out by specially-trained advisers; a package of new and existing voluntary provision known as 'Choices', including the New Deal for Disabled People and the Condition Management Programme- a new programme run in collaboration with local health providers to help individuals manage their disability or health condition; a Return to Work Credit for those entering full-time employment; and In-Work Support and other help for those entering employment.  The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) commissioned a consortium of research organisations to undertake a major programme of research into the effect of Pathways.
