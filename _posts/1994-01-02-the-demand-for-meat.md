Using Family Expenditure Survey data for five survey years over the period 1973 to 1993, a Box-Cox double-hurdle model of the participation and expenditure decisions regarding meat consumption has been estimated. Particular attention has been given to single-adult households. The effects of socio-economic characteristics on meat demand decisions are shown to have varied quite markedly over this period but some trends, particularly with respect to the age and gender of the householder, are discernible.
