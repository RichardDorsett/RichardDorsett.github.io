This study assesses the impact of memory strategies on the attainment of children identified by teachers as performing in the bottom third of their class for numeracy at the end of Key Stage 1.  Evaluated  as a randomised trial, Teaching Assistants in schools assigned to the treatment arm work with children to teach them memory strategies.  The children then use these strategies to improve their working memory skills through adaptive internet games, which they will play during a dedicated time at school as well as from home.  The primary outcome is maths attainment, as measured by administered tests.
