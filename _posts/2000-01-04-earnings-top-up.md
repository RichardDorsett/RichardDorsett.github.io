Earnings Top-up (ETU) was an in-work benefit available to low paid workers without children. It was piloted from October 1996 to October 1999 in eight areas across Britain. As part of a wider evaluation, two reports considered unemployed people (their experiences and labour market outcomes) and individuals in work (their characteristics, the effect of ETU and the reasons influencing whether those eligible took up the benefit).  These reports present descriptive statistics as well as the results of duration analyses.
