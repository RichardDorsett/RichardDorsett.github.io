This project was concerned with two means-tested benefits available to working families with children: family income supplement (FIS) and housing benefit (HB).  Take-up among eligible families of both these benefits was incomplete.  Using individual-level data from the Family Expenditure Survey, we simulated families' eligibility and entitlement to FIS and HB and estimated an econometric model to explore their influence on the take-up decision.
