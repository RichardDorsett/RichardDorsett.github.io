Mind the Gap sought to improve the metacognition and academic attainment of pupils in Year 4. There were two aspects to the intervention: first, teachers were trained in how to embed metacognitive approaches in their work and how to involve parents and, second, a series of facilitated workshops where children and parents work together to create an animated film.  The project targeted schools in four areas of England and was evaluated using a randomised controlled trial, comparing the interventions to a 'business-as-usual' control group.
