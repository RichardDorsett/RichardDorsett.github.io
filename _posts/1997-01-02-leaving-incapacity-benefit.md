This research was intended to form part of the overall assessment of the impact of the 1995 change from Invalidty Benefit and Sickness Benefit to Incapacity Benefit (IB).  This included the introduction of a new All Work Test, which was expected to increase the numbers leaving benefit.  The research focused on three outcomes: what happens to people after they leave IB (who finds work and who does not); what factors influenced the decisions of those leaving IB; and how incomes changed for those leaving.
