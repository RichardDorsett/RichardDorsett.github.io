Work-Based Learning for Adults (WBLA) is a voluntary training programme in England aimed principally at those aged 25 years and over who have been claiming Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA) for at least six months. It offers four areas of provision or 'Opportunities': Short Job-Focused Training (courses of up to six weeks duration for the most job-ready); Longer Occupational Training (to address more fundamental needs among those with benefit claims of a year or more); Basic Employability Training (for those with basic skills needs, expected to last for 26 weeks); and Self-Employment Provision (help and support for those wishing to become self-employed).  Applying propensity score matching to survey and administrative data, the aim of this evaluation was to assess the extent to which participating in WBLA affected subsequent labour market outcomes.
