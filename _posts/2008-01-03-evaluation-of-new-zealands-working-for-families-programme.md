Over the period October 2004 to April 2007, the New Zealand government introduced substantial changes to in-work incentives and financial support for families with dependent children as part of the Working for Families (WFF) package. This project estimated the impact of these changes on employment and benefit receipt outcomes for sole parents. The employment impacts used a difference-in-differences approach applied to data from the Household Labour Force Survey.  Duration analysis, applied to administrative data, was used to estimate the impact on movements off and on benefit.
