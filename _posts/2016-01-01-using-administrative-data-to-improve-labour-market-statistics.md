This project aims explores the opportunities offered by HMRC tax data to achieve a fuller understanding of labour market flows and earnings mobility. It uses four years of records collected under the Pay As You Earn Real Time Information system, covering the entire employee population of the UK from 2013/14 - 2017/18. Administrative data offer the potential to examine individuals' employment and earnings transitions over extended periods of time and for small population subgroups.  We use this to produce novel statistics and to estimate an econometric model of labour market transitions.
