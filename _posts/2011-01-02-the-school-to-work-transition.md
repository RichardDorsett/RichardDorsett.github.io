We use the British Household Panel Survey to describe young people's transitions after reaching school-leaving age (SLA) and to understand how early experiences shape later experiences.  We use sequence analysis to visualise the full detail of individuals' experiences over the first five years post-SLA and to provide a means of assessing the similarity of young people's outcomes over this period.  This in turn allows us to identify a typography of transitions and then to explore which characteristics are predictive of encountering sustained difficulties.  We then look deeper into the question of what influences transitions between employment, unemployment, education and other inactivity. Our econometric model allows for these transitions to be influenced by earlier experiences and thereby provides an insight into how young people establish themselves in employment or, less positively, how they might end up disengaged from the labour market.
