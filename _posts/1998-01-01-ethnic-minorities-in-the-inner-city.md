Ethnic minorities are concentrated in poorer areas.  Using Census data and individual-level data from the Fourth Survey of Ethnic Minorities, this project sought to probe this association by providing evidence on variations between ethnic ethnic groups in the tendency to live in relatively deprived areas.  In addition, neighbourhood composition was examined and there was shown to be variation by ethnic group in the degree to which individuals lived in areas with high ethnic minority density (the proportion of the local population who are non-white) and the degree to which they lived in areas where their own ethnic group was relatively strongly represented.
