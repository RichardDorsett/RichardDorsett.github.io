This project explores two questions related to adult skills.  The first is whether technology is effective as a (partial) means of learning delivery.  This is explored through a randomised control trial of the relative effectiveness of blended learning and face-to-face tuition in FE colleges.  The primary outcome is skill level, as measured through administered tests.  The second question is how learners' skill level change after their course.  This is examined though a large-scale longitudinal survey of learners.  In addition to asking respondents about their skills, the survey also administered its own skills assessments.
